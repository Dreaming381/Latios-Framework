-   Added `LatiosWorld.zeroToleranceForExceptions` which will cause systems to
    stop updating after a system throws an exception caught by one of the Latios
    Framework’s system update methods, preventing following systems from adding
    false errors to the error log (this is off by default)
-   Added `SyncPointPlaybackSystem.AddMainThreadCompletionForProducer()` to
    specify the command buffer was only used from the main thread

### Changed

-   **Breaking:** `ICustomConversionBootstrap` has been replaced with
    `ICustomBakingBootstrap`
-   **Breaking:** Smart Blobbers have been completely redesigned to work with
    the baking workflow and any code using them will have to be rewritten

    modified its `AssociatedComponentType` to use a `ComponentType`
-   **Breaking:** `ICollectionComponent`’s interface and related APIs have
    changed such that it is now the responsibility of the component itself to
    track if it has been initialized
-   **Breaking:** `ICollectionComponent` must now be unmanaged, and managed data
    should be migrated to a companion `IManagedStructComponent`
-   **Breaking:** Renamed `SuperSystem.GetOrCreateAndAddSystem()` to
    `SuperSystem.GetOrCreateAndAddManagedSystem()`
-   Renamed `ComponentSystemBaseSystemHandleUntypedUnion` to
    `ComponentSystemBaseSystemHandleUnion`
-   Blackboard Entities are now backed by a `LatiosWorldUnmanaged` rather than
    an `EntityManager`
-   Authoring components now use Bakers rather than implement conversion
    interfaces
-   Scene Manager now forces subscenes to load synchronously
-   `DontDestroyOnSceneChangeTag` will now prevent an entity associated with a
    subscene from being destroyed when the subscene is unloaded
-   `LatiosWorld.syncPoint` is now an unmanaged system returned by ref after a
    safety check
-   `SyncPointPlaybackSystem` is now updated by a
    `SyncPointPlaybackSystemDispatch` system type, which should be used for
    attribute-based ordering
-   System ordering in `InitializationSystemGroup` has been altered to work
    without `ConvertToEntitySystem`
-   All component types whose namespace exactly equals “Unity.Entities” are
    excluded from Blackboard Entity merging

### Fixed

-   Fixed determinism of `ParentSystem` when adding `Child` buffer

### Improved

-   All custom collections (including command buffers) no longer use
    `DisposeSentinel` and now support custom allocators
-   Both managed and unmanaged systems are created simultaneously in
    `BootstrapTools.InjectSystems()`, more closely matching Unity’s default
    behavior
-   `CoreBootstrap` now detects install conflicts at runtime
-   `EntityManager` extension methods for Collection Components and Managed
    Struct Components now only require the presence of a `LatiosWorldUnmanaged`
    rather than a full `LatiosWorld`, though using a cached
    `LatiosWorldUnmanaged` is still faster
-   Collection Components and `syncPoint` job dependencies are now automatically
    tracked for all systems updated by a Latios Framework system updater
-   `SubSystem` and `SuperSystem` now only require the presence of a
    `LatiosWorldUnmanaged` rather than a full `LatiosWorld`
-   `ImprovedTransforms` and `ExtremeHierarchy` systems are all fully unmanaged
    and Burst-compiled
-   `SyncPointPlaybackSystem` now uses a `RewindableAllocator` for command
    buffers

    replaced with `LatiosWorldUnmanaged`
-   Removed support for Collection Components and Managed Struct Components in
    `EntityDataCopyKit`

    callbacks for `ISystem` matching that of `SubSystem` and `SuperSystem`.
-   Added `GetWorldBlackboardEntity()` and `GetSceneBlackboardEntity()`
    extension methods for `SystemState` which are compatible with Burst.
-   Added `SortingSystemTracker` which can detect systems added or removed from
    a `ComponentSystemGroup`.

    returns a handle to the system currently in its `OnUpdate()` routine. This
    is compatible with Burst.
-   Added `AsManagedSystem()` extension method for `World` and `WorldUnmanaged`
    which extract the class reference of a managed system from a
    `SystemHandleUntyped`.
-   Added `GetAllSystemStates()` extension method for `WorldUnmanaged` which can
    gather all `SystemState` instances and consequently all systems in a World
    including unmanaged systems.
-   Added `WorldExposedExtensions.GetMetaIdForType()` which can generate an ID
    for a `System.Type` which can be compared against
    `SystemState.UnmanagedMetaIndex`.

### Changed

-   `BootstrapTools.InjectSystem` can now inject unmanaged systems. Many other
    `BootstrapTools` functions now handle unmanaged systems too.

### Fixed

    within a Burst context.
-   All custom `ComponentSystemGroup` types including `SuperSystem` and
    `RootSuperSystem` support unmanaged systems.
-   All custom `ComponentSystemGroup` types including `SuperSystem` and
    `RootSuperSystem` support `IRateManager`.
-   All custom `ComponentSystemGroup` types including `SuperSystem` and
    `RootSuperSystem` support automatic system sorting when systems are added
    and removed.
-   Fixed an issue where the managed and collection component reactive systems
    were being stripped in builds.
-   Fixed an issue with `EntityDataCopyKit` not handling default-valued shared
    components correctly.

### Improved

-   All custom `ComponentSystemGroup` types including `SuperSystem` and
    `RootSuperSystem` behave much more like Unity’s systems regarding error
    handling.

## [0.4.3] – 2022-2-21

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Fixed

-   Fixed GC allocations caused by using a foreach on `IReadOnlyList` type
-   Removed a reference to the Input System package in Latios.Core.asmdef

## [0.4.2] – 2021-10-5

    NetCode projects.

### Improved

-   Improved the error message for when a `SubSystem` begins its `OnUpdate()`
    procedure but the previous `SubSystem` did not clean up the automatic
    dependency stack. The error now identifies both systems and suggests the
    more likely cause being an exception in the previous `SubSystem`.

## [0.4.1] – 2021-9-16

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Added

-   Added `simd.length()`.
-   Added `simd.select()` which allows for selecting the x, y, and z components

    y, and z for each of the four float3 values.
-   Added `simd.abs()`.
-   Added `simd.project()`.
-   Added `simd.isfiniteallxyz()` which returns true for each float3 if the x,
    y, and z components are all finite values.

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Added

-   Added argument `isInitialized` to
    `BlackboardEntity.AddCollectionComponent()`
-   *New Feature:* Added `OnNewScene()` callback to `SubSystem` and
    `SuperSystem`, which can be used to initialize components on the
    `sceneBlackboardEntity`.
-   *New Feature:* Added `EntityWith<T>` and `EntityWithBuffer<T>` for strongly
    typed entity references and left-to-right dereferencing chains.
-   Added `LatiosMath.ComplexMul()`.
-   *New Feature:* Added `Rng` and `RngToolkit` which provide a new framework
    for fast, deterministic, parallel random number generation.

### Improved

-   Added safety checks for improper usage of `sceneBlackboardEntity` that would
    only cause issues in builds.

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Fixed

-   Fixed several compiler errors when creating builds
-   Removed dangling references to the Code Analysis package in
    Latios.Core.Editor.asmdef

## [0.3.0] – 2021-3-4

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Added

-   **Breaking**: Added `LatiosWorld.useExplicitSystemOrdering`. You must now
    set this value to true in an `ICustomBootstrap` before injecting additional
    systems.
-   Added the following convenience properties to `LatiosWorld`:
    `initializationSystemGroup`, `simulationsSystemGroup`,
    `presentationSystemGroup `
-   *New Feature:* Added `GameObjectConversionConfigurationSystem` which when
    subclassed allows for customizing the conversion world before any other
    systems run. Not all entities have been gathered when `OnUpdate()` is
    called. Note that this mechanism is likely temporary and may change after a
    Unity bug is fixed.
-   *New Feature:* Added the following containers: `EnableCommandBuffer`,
    `DisableCommandBuffer`, `DestroyCommandBuffer`, `InstantiateCommandBuffer`,
    `EntityOperationCommandBuffer`
-   *New Feature:* Added `SyncPointPlaybackSystem` which can play back
    `EntityCommandBuffers` as well as the new command buffer types
-   *New Feature:* Added `LatiosWorld.syncPoint` which provides fast access to
    the `SyncPointPlaybackSystem` and removes the need to call
    `AddJobHandleForProducer()` when invoked from a `SubSystem`
-   Added `BlackboardEntity.AddComponentDataIfMissing<T>(T data)` which systems
    can use to default-initialize `worldBlackboardEntity` components in
    `OnCreate()` without overriding custom settings
-   Added `PreSyncPointGroup` for scheduling non-ECS jobs to execute on worker
    threads during the sync point
-   Added extension `BlobBuilder.ConstructFromNativeArray<T>()` which allows
    initializing a `BlobArray<T>` from a `NativeArray<T>`
-   Added extension `BlobBuilder.AllocateFixedString<T>()` which allows
    initializing a `BlobString` from a `FixedString###` or `HeapString` inside a
    Burst job
-   Added extension `NativeList<T>.AddRangeFromBlob()` which appends the
    `BlobArray` data to the list
-   Added extension `StringBuilder.Append()` which works with `FixedString###`
    hi
-   Added new assembly `Entities.Exposed` which uses the namespace
    `Unity.Entities.Exposed` and extends the API with the following:
    -   `EntityLocationInChunk` – a new struct type
    -   Extension method `EntityManager.GetEntityLocationInChunk()` used for
        advanced algorithms
    -   Extension method `World.ExecutingSystemType()` used for profiling
-   Added new assembly `MathematicsExpansion` which extends the
    `Unity.Mathematics.math` API with `select()` functions for `bool` types
-   `Added lots of new API for simdFloat3`

### `Changed`

-   **Breaking:** Global Entities have been renamed to Blackboard Entities. See
    upgrade guide for details.
-   `TransfomUniformScalePatchConversionSystem` was moved from
    `Latios.Authoring` to `Latios.Authoring.Systems`
-   **Breaking:** Renamed `LatiosSyncPointGroup` to `LatiosWorldSyncGroup`
-   **Breaking:** `LatiosInitializationSystemGroup`,
    `LatiosSimulationSystemGroup`, `LatiosPresentationSystemGroup`,
    `LatiosFixedSimulationSystemGroup`, `PreSyncPointGroup`, and
    `LatiosWorldSyncGroup` all use `SuperSystem` updating behavior.
    `SuperSystem` and `SubSystem` types added to one of these groups will now
    have `ShouldUpdateSystem()` invoked. Unfortunately, this also means that
    `ISystemBase` systems added to these groups will not function. `ISystemBase`
    is advised against in the short-term. But if you must have it, put it inside
    a custom `ComponentSystemGroup` instead.

### Removed

-   BurstPatcher has been removed.

### Improved

-   Systems created in `LatiosWorld` now use attribute-based ordering which may
    improve compatibility with more DOTS projects
-   All authoring components have now been categorized under *Latios-\>Core* in
    the *Add Component* menu
-   All authoring components now have public access so that custom scripts can
    reference them
-   **Breaking:** `BlackboardEntity` methods have been revised to more closely
    resemble `EntityManager` methods
-   Added an additional argument to `BootstrapTools.InjectUnitySystems()` which
    silences warnings and made this silencing behavior default
-   Setting `DestroyEntitiesOnSceneChangeSystem.Enabled` to `false` disables its
    functionality

## [0.2.2] - 2021-1-24

    DOTS evolution. See the documentation for how to use them.
-   `FixedString` is used instead of `NativeString`
-   `BootstrapTools.UpdatePlayerLoopWithFixedUpdate` is now
    `BootstrapTools.AddWorldToCurrentPlayerLoopWithFixedUpdate` with updated API
    to mirror `ScriptBehaviorUpdateOrder`
-   `EntityDataCopyKit` now ignores collection components by default
-   `SubSystem` now subclasses `SystemBase` and should be used for all logical
    systems
-   `LatiosInitializationSystemGroup` was reworked for compatibility with the
    latest Entities

### Removed
