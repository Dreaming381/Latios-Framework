## [0.5.2] – 2022-7-3

Officially supports Entities [0.50.1]

### Added

-   Added Linux support
-   Added `SkeletonClip.SamplePose()` overload which uses a `BufferPoseBlender`
    and performs optimal pose sampling
-   Added `BufferPoseBlender` which can temporarily repurpose a
    `DynamicBuffer<OptimizedBoneToRoot>` into a working buffer of
    `BoneTransform`s for additive pose sampling (blending) and IK and then
    convert the resulting `BoneTransform`s back into valid `OptimizedBoneToRoot`
    values

### Fixed

-   Fixed `ShaderEffectRadialBounds` which was ignored
-   Fixed issue where root motion animation was applied directly to the
    `OptimizedBoneToRoot` buffer when using pose sampling

### Improved

-   Fixed change filtering of exposed bone bounds
-   ACL Unity plugin binaries are now built using GitHub Actions and have a
    tagged release which includes artifacts for debug symbols as well as
    human-readable assembly text

## [0.5.1] – 2022-6-19

Officially supports Entities [0.50.1]

### Added

-   Added `SkeletonClip.SamplePose()` which uses a fast path to compute the
    entire `OptimizedBoneToRoot` buffer
-   Added bool `hasAnyParentScaleInverseBone` and bitmask array
    `hasChildWithParentScaleInverseBitmask` to `OptimizedSkeletonHierarchyBlob`
    which can be used to detect if an inverse scale value needs to be calculated
    in advance
-   Added `SkeletonClip.boneCount` for safety purposes
-   Added `SkeletonClip.sampleRate` for convenience when using other
    `KeyframeInterpolationMode`s than the default
-   Added `SkeletonClip.sizeUncompressed` and `SkeletonClip.sizeCompressed` to
    compare the efficacies of different compression levels

### Fixed

-   Fixed a bug where only the first skeleton archetype was used for rendering
-   Skinned Mesh Renderers are no longer treated as bones in the skeleton during
    conversion
-   Fixed a bug where the first clip in a `SkeletonClipSetBakeData` was
    duplicated for all of the clips in the resulting `SkeletonClipSetBlob`
-   Scene root transforms are no longer baked into `SkeletonClip`
-   `InstallKinemationConversion()` now works correctly when the conversion
    bootstrap returns `false`
-   Applied the Hybrid Renderer 0.51 specular reflections bugfix to Kinemation’s
    renderer

## [0.5.0] – 2022-6-13

### This is the first release of *Kinemation*.
