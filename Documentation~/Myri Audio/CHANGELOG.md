## [0.6.1] – 2022-11-28

Officially supports Entities [1.0.0 prerelease 15]

This release only contains internal compatibility changes

## [0.6.0] – 2022-11-16

Officially supports Entities [1.0.0 experimental]

### Added

-   *New Feature:* Added Smart Blobber which allows for providing custom audio
    samples without an `AudioClip` object
-   Added `IListenerProfileBuilder` for building profiles with stack-allocated
    data
-   Added `Baker.BuildAndRegisterListenerProfileBlob()` extension method for
    creating `ListenerProfileBlob` blob assets

### Changed

-   **Breaking:** Authoring has been completely rewritten to use baking workflow

### Improved

-   `AudioSystem` is now a Burst-compiled ISystem

## [0.5.7] – 2022-8-28

Officially supports Entities [0.51.1]

### Changed

-   Explicitly applied Script Updater changes for hashmap renaming

## [0.5.6] – 2022-8-21

Officially supports Entities [0.50.1] – [0.51.1]

### Fixed

-   Fixed Editor Mode Game Object Conversion when destroying the default audio
    listener profile configurator

## [0.5.2] – 2022-7-3

Officially supports Entities [0.50.1]

### Fixed

-   Fixed stereo clip conversion crash introduced in 0.5.0

## [0.5.0] – 2022-6-13

Officially supports Entities [0.50.1]

### Added

-   *New Feature:* `AudioClipBlob` and `ListenerProfileBlob` are now generated
    using Smart Blobbers and generation can be requested from user authoring
    code
-   Myri is now installed via a `MyriBootstrap` installer, allowing users to
    exclude it if creating a `DSPGraph` instance breaks their project

### Changed

-   Renamed `IldProfileBlob` to `ListenerProfileBlob`

### Fixed

-   `AudioClipBlob.name` is now a `FixedString128Bytes` and can be used in Burst
-   Myri will now ignore null `AudioClipBlob` instances rather than crash

## [0.4.5] – 2022-3-20

Officially supports Entities [0.50.0]

### Changed

-   Updated DSPGraph to 0.1.0-preview.22.

### Fixed

-   Myri is now compatible with Burst 1.6.4.

## [0.4.4] – 2022-3-13

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Added

-   Added a new option for looping audio sources to begin playing from the
    beginning at spawn rather than a voice offset. While this drastically
    reduces voice-combining potential, it is useful for background music and
    similar use cases.

### Fixed

-   Fixed an issue where the ITD offset would cause arrays to be indexed with a
    negative value.

### Improved

-   Added XML documentation and tooltips for a significant amount of Myri.

## [0.4.3] – 2022-2-21

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Fixed

-   Fixed missing asset dependency declarations during conversion for subscenes.

## [0.4.0] – 2021-8-9

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Added

-   Added AudioSettings.lookaheadAudioFrames which can be used to correct for
    when sampling regularly takes too long to deliver to the audio thread.

### Changed

-   **Breaking:** The concept of “subframes” has been removed. Audio sources now
    synchronize with the actual audio frame definition. In audioSettings,
    audioFramesPerUpdate now represents how many frames are expected to be
    played before the next buffer is consumed, effectively replicating the old
    subframe behavior. A new variable named safetyAudioFrames represents how
    many additional audio frames to sample in each update to prevent starvation.

### Improved

-   Myri is now more robust to AudioSettings changes while clips are playing.
-   *New Feature:* Myri now has a brickwall limiter at the end of its DSP chain
    on the audio thread. The current implementation may consume measurable
    resources on the audio thread and potentially lead to performance
    regressions. However, this limiter removes the distortion artifacts when too
    many loud audio sources play at once. Balancing the volume of audio sources
    is much less important now, and the overall out-of-the-box quality has
    greatly improved.

## [0.3.3] – 2021-6-19

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Fixed

-   Fixed an issue where looping sources with a sample rate different from the
    output sample rate would begin sampling from the wrong location each update.

## [0.3.2] – 2021-5-25

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### Fixed

-   Renamed some files so that Unity would not complain about them matching the
    names of GameObject components.

## [0.3.0] – 2021-3-4

Officially supports Entities [0.17.0]

### This is the first release of *Myri Audio*.
