# Latios Framework for Unity ECS – [0.6.6]

The Latios Framework is a powerful suite of high-performance low-level APIs and
feature-sets for Unity’s ECS which aims to give you back control over your
gameplay. If you like the general paradigms, syntax, and workflows of Unity’s
ECS, but find Unity’s offerings to be incomplete or frustratingly full of quirky
unintuitive details, then this framework may be exactly what you need to achieve
your vision.

The Latios Framework does not replace Unity’s ECS, but rather complements it
with additional APIs and tools. In some cases, the Latios Framework may override
Unity ECS’s underlying mechanisms to provide more features. Desktop platforms
are supported out-of-the-box. Other platforms may require additional effort to
achieve functionality and performance benefits.

Originally, this framework was for my own personal hobbyist game development,
and in a sense, still is. However, after several years of development, it has
proven a valuable resource to the Unity ECS community. It is provided here free
to use for personal or commercial usage and modification. All modules are
licensed under the [Unity Companion
License](https://unity3d.com/legal/licenses/Unity_Companion_License). The
modules may contain code borrowed from official Unity packages and therefore may
be seen as derivative works. Despite this, the Latios Framework contains many
adaptations of top-class solutions in the industry (see [Third Party
Notices](THIRD%20PARTY%20NOTICES.md)) as well as original inventions geared
towards Unity’s ECS.

The Latios Framework is best-known in the community for Kinemation, a module
which provides extremely high-performance CPU animation and GPU skinned mesh
rendering features.

This version targets Entities 1.0.0 prerelease 15. If you are still using
Entities 0.51.1, please use the framework version 0.5.8 instead.

**Note: This release is not compatible with Entities Prerelease 47 due to
instability issues with that release.** An experimental compatible version can
be obtained on request.

The 0.6.x series uses Transforms V1, which can be enabled in your project via
the Scripting Define Symbol ENABLE_TRANSFORM_V1. If you are using Transforms V2,
please wait for a newer version of the Latios Framework.

*[0.5.x] users, please read the* [*Upgrade
Guide*](Documentation~/Upgrade%20Guide.md)*!*

## Why Use the Latios Framework?

Typically, “frameworks” fall into one of two categories. Either, they are
someone’s collection of convenience classes and extension methods, or they
define a specific architecture and workflow for describing gameplay code.

While the Latios Framework has some of those things, its primary concerns are at
the engine level. Many of its tools and solutions are inspired by GDC
presentations, technical blogs, and research papers. A key focus of the
framework is to make these advanced technologies usable within a DOTS-based
production environment. But another common theme is fixing or providing
alternatives for fundamental design issues in the official ECS packages. For
technical reasons, it is a “framework”, but the individual APIs act more like a
toolkit and stay out of the way. A developer using it should always feel in
control. If not, there’s likely an issue worth bringing to attention.

0.5 marked the end of Phase II, where focus was placed on enabling technologies
in DOTS such as audio and animation. Current Phase III development focuses on
gameplay technologies such as spatial and hierarchical queries, simulation, and
AI tools.

Long term, the Latios Framework’s mission is to dramatically reduce the
development effort required to make highly artistic 3D games and short films.

## Getting Started

There are three methods to install the framework package (contains all publicly
released packages).

-   Clone or submodule this repository into your project’s Packages folder
    (recommended for contributors or those wanting faster bugfixes and updates)
-   Add package via Package Manager -\> Add package from git URL
-   Add via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.latios.latiosframework/)

After installing the framework package, follow the instructions in the first
section [here](Documentation~/Core/Getting%20Started.md). You may also want to
look through the [compatibility
guide](Documentation~/Installation%20and%20Compatibility%20Guide.md).

Getting Started pages and documentation are provided with each module.

## Support

*TL;DR – I try to take issues and feedback as seriously as if this were a
commercial project (or for the cynical, to shame commercial projects). Do not
hesitate to reach out to me!*

### Issues

This is a hobby project and not my full-time job, so I cut corners and don’t
spend a lot of time testing things. Sometimes I write code while an idea is in
my head and just leave it there. Bugs will sneak in.

However, **bugs are infuriating!**

If you see a confusing error, send me a description of what you were doing and a
stack trace with line numbers and the version you are using. You can use the
GitHub issues, GitHub discussions, Discord, the DOTS forums, Unity PMs, or
emails. Usually, I will find a bug fix locally, and provide instructions on how
to apply the fix yourself. Then I will roll out the bug fix in my next release.

For strange behavior that doesn’t trigger errors, a repro is the only way to
guarantee the issue gets diagnosed, but a good description can go a long ways
too.

For performance issues, if you can’t send me a repro, send me a profile capture.
It doesn’t matter if the issue makes your game unplayable or if you just want
one task to be a couple hundred microseconds faster. I’m interested!

### Feature Requests

Please send feature requests, even if it is already listed on one of the
near-term roadmaps. It helps me prioritize. Requests for small utility functions
or other simple concerns can usually be squeezed in patch releases. I always
reserve full discretion. Try to propose your use case, and focus less on a
proposed solution.

### Learning Resource Requests

If you see gaps in the documentation, or are struggling to understand features,
let me know. If you would like more demos and samples, also let me know what you
would like an example of. I won’t build your game idea for you, but simple
things I can try and squeeze in.

### Derivatives, Collaboration, and Contribution

I develop this framework separately from this repository scattered across
various projects. I will provide the current snapshot from any of those projects
upon request. I promise the code may be terrible. This may be useful to you if
you desire to contribute in an area I am actively developing. See
[Contributing](Documentation~/Contributing.md) for more information.

If you are developing your own packages on top of this framework, commercial or
open source, feel free to reach out to me for suggestions, guidance, or to
establish your stake in the areas that concern you. It is important to me that
such dependent technologies are successful. For open source projects, I may even
send a pull request.

### Feature Releases and Compatibility

I do not promise backwards compatibility between feature releases (0.X). I will
have upgrade guides detailing all the breakages and what to change. But it will
be a manual process.

Patch releases (0.6.X) will always preserve backwards compatibility back to the
last feature release.

While I will provide tips and suggestions if you use older releases, I will not
publish patch releases for older versions.
